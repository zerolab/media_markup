# Media: Markup

Media: Markup provides support reusable snippets of content that can be managed in centralised manner.
Created as an alternative to [Token Insert Entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/token_insert_entity) due
to permission restrictions.

Typical example of snippets include:

- repeated elements of copy, e.g. details of how to apply used on each course page
- other reused rich text, e.g. a table of term dates or standard disclaimers.

The advantage of snippets over traditional Drupal approaches of blocks or content types is that they can be embedded anywhere within rich text fields, without the overhead.

Technically, snippets are managed as media entities in a similar way to images and documents.
